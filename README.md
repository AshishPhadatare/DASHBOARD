# DASHBOARD
This dashboard is created for monitoring purpose of multiple servers. SSH connectivity, diskspace utilization of servers and other infra details will be displayed on webpage.
If SSH is down or utilized diskspace is more than threshold set, dashboard will trigger mail also to respective stakeholders. This whole set-up doesn't require any database software in it's functionality.

Tech used:
1) Apache2 to host Dashboard
2) HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT for web technologies.
3) Python
4) Bash script
